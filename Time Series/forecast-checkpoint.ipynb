    "The objective of the research behind the paper was to validate different methods and approaches related to sales time series data preparation, analysis and forecasting, with aim to facilitate recommending sales and marketing strategies based on trend/seasonality effects and forecasting sales of eight different groups of pharmaceutical products with diverse characteristics, such as stationarity, seasonality, amount of residuals and sales data variance. All these analyses and forecasts are made on a small scale, for a single distributor, pharmacy chain or even individual pharmacy. Paper presents only research work related to univariate time series analysis, while potential candidates for explanatory input variables were also identified and shortly elaborated. Effectiveness of three forecasting methods, namely ARIMA, Facebook’s Prophet and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks was investigated. Each of the method is complemented with two optimization and validation approaches, relevant for short-term (so called rolling forecast scenario) and long-term forecasting.\n"

    "On a larger scale, the sales forecasting in pharmaceutical industry is typically done by using Naïve model, where the forecasted values equal values in the previous period with added factor of growth, which is specifically defined for different regions, markets, categories of products, etc. Although this model fails when the market saturates, in general and on a larger scale, it has proven as successful. Still, analysis and forecasts on a smaller scale, such as single distributor, pharmacy chain or even individual pharmacy, smaller periods such as weeks, etc., guide very important decisions related to resource and procurement planning, what-if analyses, return-on-investment forecasting, business planning and others. The main problem in smaller scale time series analyses and forecasts are significant uncertainties and sales performance very close to random, making the forecasts with accuracies above thresholds as defined by Naïve methods difficult to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main research question we tackle is related to exploring the feasibility of use of modern time-series forecasting methods in pharmaceutical products sales forecasting on a smaller scale. In specific, we benchmark the accuracies achieved with those methods against the performances of basic Naïve, Seasonal Naïve and Average methods.\n",

    "Research work behind the paper considers 8 time series with different statistical features. Each of the time-series summarizes sales of a group of pharmaceutical products. Time-series data are collected from the Point-of-Sale system of a single pharmacy in period of 6 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is structured into 4 main parts. First, short theoretical background for time series analysis and forecasting is provided to inform the reader on the credibility of decisions made in the implementation of this case study. Then, research methodology, actually a problem-neutral time series forecasting pipeline is presented. Next, the actual implementation is presented, by highlighting the steps made in following the proposed methodology in the case of pharmaceutical products sales data analysis and forecasting. Finally, the discussion brings the description of actual results and some suggestions to the sales department, driven by the result of the data analysis."

    "Time series is a sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly). Its analysis involves understanding various aspects of the time series, important for creating meaningful and accurate forecasts.\n",

    "level (mean of time-series data);\n",

    "seasonality (the repeating short-term cycle in the series); and\n",
    "noise or residuals (random variations in the series).\n",

    "In multiplicative series, changes increase or decrease over time:\n",

    "y(t) = Level Trend Seasonality * Noise\n",

    "There are many different methods and approaches to time-series forecasting. The simplest methods which are typically used for determining baseline forecasting performance are Average, Naïve and Seasonal Naïve (those models are often used as benchmark models). In Average method, the forecasts of all future values are equal to mean of the historical data. If the dataset is split to train and test sets, then Average of training set is used as a forecast. For Naïve forecasts, all forecasts are set to be values of the last observation, or: ft+1=ot. Naïve forecasts are considered optimal when data follow a random walk and they can be used only in walk-forward or rolling forecasts, not in long-term forecasting. Seasonal Naïve method is useful for time-series that show seasonality effects. Each forecast is set to be equal to the mean of the observed values from the same time in previous seasonal cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal decomposition can be also used for forecasting, by building the model (by using any other approach) on the time-series data with subtracted residual component, as calculated by any of the decomposition methods (such as STL). Another, quite successful classical forecasting method is Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), where forecasts are calculated as: ot+1=αot+α(1-α)ot-1+ α(1-α)2ot-2+..+ α(1-α)not-n, with: 0<α<1. Here, the forecast is equal to a weighted average of the past observations, where weights decrease exponentially as we go back in time. There are also improved SES methods which consider trends and seasonality."
